### Overall Analysis
The coffee shop industry in one of the most 
difficult businesses to turn a consistent profit in. 
Costs are high, margins are narrow, and 
competition is constant. It appears that the 
coffee shops are doing pretty well towards the 
winter seasons which makes sense as the 
weather is usually cold and that is the time were 
people appreciate warm bevarages.

### Recommendations to Boost Sales

 ÔÇ¥ To keep the revenue increase across all seasons, 
    we can develop a high-margin breakfast 
    offering.
 ÔÇ¥ Breakfast is one of the most cost-effective 
    categories in food service. Items like muffins 
    croissants, egg sandwiches, and bagels are 
    inexpensive to produce and pair well with 
    coffee. They require relatively simple preparation 
    and can be sold at a strong mark.
